# App Candidate

## About the project
App Candidate is a web app with database for candidates to have all their applications in one place, so they can easily know which stage they are in at each company.

In the app it is possible to register the company for which you applied, create the job you applied for and show the status you're in. Within the application, it is possible to create tasks to be done and send an email to the registered company email.
